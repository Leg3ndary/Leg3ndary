## Projects

My main focus as of now is [BennyBot](https://github.com/Leg3ndary/Benny), a discord bot written in python.

I am also working on a new package [complain](https://github.com/Leg3ndary/complain), a way to complain about others!

Another package I'm workin gon is an asynchronous translator [aiogtrans](https://github.com/Leg3ndary/aiogtrans), it uses translate.google.com's api.

Another project though I'm slowly working on is [tagscript-docs](https://github.com/Leg3ndary/tagscript-docs), modernized documentation for Carl-bots tagscript with [Readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.org)
